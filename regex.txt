regular expressions

/the/gi -finds "the" in the string ignoring CASE (capital letters/uppercase)

    / is the start of the regular expression.
    the is the pattern we want to match.
    / is the end of the regular expression.
    g means global, which causes the pattern to return all matches in the string, not just the first one.
    i means that we want to ignore the case (uppercase or lowercase) when searching for the pattern.

/\d+/g -finds all the digits in a string

    One such selector is the digit selector \d which is used to retrieve one digit (e.g. numbers 0 to 9) in a string.
    In JavaScript, it is used like this: /\d/g.
    Appending a plus sign (+) after the selector, e.g. /\d+/g, allows this regular expression to match one or more digits.
    The trailing g is short for 'global', which allows this regular expression to find all matches rather than stop at the first match.

/\s+/g -finds all spaces in a string

    The whitespace characters are " " (space), \s (space), \r (the carriage return), \n (newline), \t (tab), and \f (the form feed).

/\S/g -finds all nonspaces in string

    invert any match by using the uppercase version of the regular expression selector
    For example, \s will match any whitespace, and \S will match anything that isn't whitespace.
