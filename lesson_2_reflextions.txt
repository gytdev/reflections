What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-When You initialize a repository, git creates the required files for a new project. Everything that is needed to start version 
control and checking between commitscd 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-The staging area is like a safety buffer for us to add only the files we want to add and not all the files that are
in the CWD(current working directory). So it helps us to do things more strategically without forcing us to commit Everything

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-the best thing would be to be mindful of doing commits the right way

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
-You use branch out your master branch to another branch if You want to make some experimental feature and
keep Your core code intact. You get the same version of all your files plus keep the old ones. So You can experiment on
the branch and see if the code is good to implement permenentelly to Your core code. This can also be used to customize
Your code to different clients or to make different translations for Your code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
-It helps me understand which commits point to which branch and which commit might be ommited (discarted) after I
checkout to some branch

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
-When merging a branch to master: all the commits of the merged branch are put in the master branch and sorted by date. 
The merged branch becomes obselete and we can delete it.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
-if two authors make a change on the same part of the code (ie. function), there will be a conflict with
git automerging. It will not make any changes to the code and say that there was a conflict. Which is 
good for You and annoying, because You have to sort the conflict Yourself. It wastes time, but decreases errors.
