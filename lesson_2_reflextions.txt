What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When You initialize a repository, git creates the required files for a new project. Everything that is needed to start version 
control and checking between commitscd 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is like a safety buffer for us to add only the files we want to add and not all the files that are
in the CWD(current working directory). So it helps us to do things more strategically without forcing us to commit Everything
